# FIFA-ANALYSIS

It is a well known fact that sports analytics are very popular. The dataset fifa.csv contains
information about soccer (football) players obtained from FIFA19 information. It would be
interesting if the ratings that are used could be analyzed as a simple set of factors.
a) Identify the columns that are the best candidates for analysis as factors.
b) Conduct a factor analysis using these columns (if you get an error reduce the number of
factors in the function, until the error disappears).
c) Justify your use of the rotation method. What does it tell you ?
d) Are there any correlations between the factors?
e) Split the data set into two parts (Left footed players and right footed players). Conduct a
factor analysis and explain if you see any differences between right and left footed
players . Note you do not need to draw this one.


The FIFA Director of Analytics isn’t completely convinced with your prior analysis. The belief is
that your analysis isn’t useful. Use the original fifa.csv dataset.
a) Explain how your prior FIFA analysis was useful and how it can be used.
Ultimately there needs to be a unifying factor across all techniques used. If the primary
question is how to build a team then your job will be to develop a methodology that will
assist in this, therefore,
b) How would you group players ? Be sure to establish what fields are necessary prior to
grouping and indicate how you grouped them. Then describe the groups.
c) Using the groups can you assess the clubs. Explain if this is useful.
d) How can your initial analysis (from Homework 2) be integrated with b and/or c?
e) Can you find any other useful and interesting analytics (from our techniques) that would
be helpful to the Director of Analytics.
